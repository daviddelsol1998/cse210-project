Class Ideas:

Screen - would be in charge of drawing all of the actors every cycle.

Board(Sprite) - a subclass of the Sprite class that is creates a list (or board) that can be populated by images of waves and then have
ships randomly placed on it. Will be labeled A-J, 1-10.

Ship(Sprite) - a subclass of the Sprite class that is in charge of all of the ships on the board. Handles placing the ships,
setting the image, and collisions. 

UserSelection - a class that handles the user input of clicking, and checks if the clicked location is the location of a ship on the board.
